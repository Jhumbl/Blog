During my time at the Centre of Urban Science and Progress at King's College London, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Westminster City Council to evaluate the current distribution of electric vehicle infrastructure and advise its most efficient distribution. This project used electric vehicle charging transaction data from 2018-2019 and included data mining, spatial statistics and network analysis techniques in order to address the problems they were facing.

An executive summary of the project can be seen below. If the report can not be seen, a pdf can been found [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](/pdfs/executive_summary_EV.pdf).
