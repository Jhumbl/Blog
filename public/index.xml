      <description>The 2019 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 12 December 2019. The Conservative Party, having failed to obtain a majority in the 2017 general election, had faced a prolonged parliamentary deadlock over Brexit while it governed in minority with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which had forced the resignation of the previous Prime Minister Theresa May. As a result, Boris Johnson called for an early election to take place in December, which was eventually passed into law.</description>

      <description>During my time at the Centre of Urban Science and Progress at King&amp;rsquo;s College London, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Westminster City Council to evaluate the current state of electric vehicle charge point infrastructure and advise its most efficient distribution. This project used electric vehicle charging transaction data from 2018-2019 and included data mining, spatial statistics and network analysis techniques in order to address the problems they were facing.</description>

      <description>The 2018 revision of the United Nations World Urbanisation Prospects state that 55% of the world population is currently living in urban areas1. This figure is set to increase to 68% by 2050. Now, North America stands as the most urbanised, with 82% of its population living in urban areas. The definition of “smart city” has not been explicitly articulated in the literature with varying suggestions under differing prefixes such as “intelligent”2 and “digital”3.</description>

      <description>This project aims to answer the question: Where are the best places to live in London? It does this by composite, weight indexing of a number of different variables. Six variables were chosen based on attributes one might look for when buying a property. These six variables are as follows:
 House Prices
 Air Pollution
 Crime Density
 Population Density
 Hospital Accessibility
 Transport Accessibility  Data for all six attributes were collected and visualised in ArcGIS.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
